In this project, I used a free designed landing page from Figma -
https://www.figma.com/design/mVjpT84IChxhDcLq8Y0nDQ/Free-Landing-Page%2C-Desktop-%2B-Mobile---VC-(Community)?node-id=1-828&t=qjFrpCuDlRqkCkzW-0

The app is fully responsive(mobile, smile, lg screens), built on top of Next.js with Tailwind for styling.

The application features:

- full responsiveness, allowing both the interface and images to adjust perfectly to any screen size
- mobile/desktop navbar
- interactive tooltips (essentials, pricing, questions sections)
- contextual hints that open to guide users
- caruseal on dekstop with users comments

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
